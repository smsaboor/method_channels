# method_channels

Flutter project to run Native code using platform channel.

##Flutter Platform Channel:

This application is an example which will showcase the MethodChannel which is used to communicate your Dart code 
with the platform-specific code/api (native side like android/iOS/windows/linux) in bidirectional way.
Here we take example of display battery level of native device and device information.
we code its logic on native side eg: for android we write native code in
F:\method_channels\android\app\src\main\kotlin\com\example\method_channels\MainActivity.kt file and call it using
method channel from dart code.
